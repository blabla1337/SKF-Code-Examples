# Audit logs
-------

## Example:


    """
    The log function does not have to be complicated as long as you log at least these 6 values

    Whenever a user is registered or added to your system, the application must also
    automatically generate a table for this user which contains his userID, counter and blocker
    variable in order to keep track of his behavior.
    """

REMARK Glenn: Please check the ASVS audit log section for what to log for example i miss the IP of the user. Also needs more comments about what the threat is like LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH. Also value should be message for example: User triggered search function
